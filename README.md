# My first neural network

This is my project submission for the Deep Learning Foundation nano degree by Udacity. 

In this project, I built my first neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction the daily bike rental ridership. By building a neural network from ground up, instead of making use of popular tools, I gained a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other important concepts. 

You can directly view my work by opening the html file in a browser. You will need python 3, numpy, pandas and jupyter notebook if you wish to run the code. Other requirements are in the requirements.txt file.

The data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Database (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset). The data is already included in the repo.
